Hangman - Nib-Less Cocoa Application in Common Lisp Example
===========================================================


This is an implementation of the hangman game for MacOSX / Cocoa,
written in Common Lisp with ccl.


This demonstrates a simple Cocoa application written with ccl, without
using xib/nib files, but constructing the user interface entirely
programmatically (cf files nsapi.lisp and hangman-controller.lisp).


Development
-----------

The program can be loaded with quicklisp in arunning ccl image for
development and debugging.  Note

    (push #P"~/src/hangman/src/" asdf:*central-registry*)
    (ql:quickload :com.informatimago.hangman)
    (in-package :com.informatimago.hangman.cocoa)
    (objcl:set-objective-cl-syntax)
    (progn
      (setf *controller* [[HangmanController alloc] init])
      [*controller* createUI]
      (initialize-game *controller*))

after modifications, one can reset it with:

   (progn
     [*controller* dropUI]
     [*controller* createUI]
     (initialize-game *controller*))


Production
----------

To generate the application package, with the Makefile:

    make

This generates an application package on the desktop named
Hangman.app, using the generate-application.lisp script.
